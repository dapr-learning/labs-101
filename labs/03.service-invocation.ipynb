    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Dapr provides Service Invocation API for applications to communicate with each other in a reliable and secure fashion using the standard gRPC or HTTP protocols. Dapr addresses several challenges related to service-to-service communications like discovering services, invoking methods between services, secure communication etc. With Dapr Service Invocation API, an application just uses the `invoke` API on it's own Dapr instance to call other applications that have unique IDs. It allows applications to talk to each other via named unique identifiers and puts the burden of service discovery on Dapr runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following steps are undertaken in a standard service-to-service invocation using Dapr. Note that every application running with Dapr has a unique application ID which is used by other applications while invoking methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Service A makes an HTTP or gRPC call to it's own Dapr sidecar targeting service B. \n",
    "1. Dapr discovers Service B location using name-resolution component\n",
    "1. Dapr forwards the mesage to Service B's Dapr sidecar\n",
    "1. Service B's Dapr sidecar forwards the request to specific endpoint on service B.\n",
    "1. Service B runs it's logic.\n",
