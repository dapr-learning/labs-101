    "Dapr provides publish & subscribe apis for microservices to communicate with each other using messages for event-driven architectures. You can use Dapr to publish message on a topic to a supported message broker ( such as kafka, redis etc.) and also subscribe to topics. The message broker will receive messages for a topic from publisher and send it to all the subscribers of the topic. The list of brokers can be found [here](https://docs.dapr.io/reference/components-reference/supported-pubsub/). \n",
